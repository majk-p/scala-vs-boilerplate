# What's boilerplate?

# What's boilerplate?

Something you have to write but you don't want to

---

# Like what?

---

# Like this

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="">

# How to identify boilerplate?

---

# Boilerplate characteristics

* repetitive
* unnecessary
* burdensome

---

# Is it a real problem?

What's your opinion?

---

# Seems it is

2015 study on popular Java projects shows that 60% of methods can be uniquely identified by the occurrence of 4.6% of its tokens, making the remaining 95.4% boilerplate irrelevant to logic

# What's scala anyway

* Functional and Object oriented
* concise, high-level language
* statically typed
* runs on JVM, JS and Native with LVM

---

# How does it help?

Let's see some examples,

Take the good old `hello world` for starters

---

# Java

```java
public class MyMainClass {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

---

# Python

```python
def main():
  println("hello world")

if __name__ == '__main__': 
  main()
```
---

# Python

```python
def main():
  println("hello world")

# this might be omitted depending how Pythonic you feel
if __name__ == '__main__': 
  main()
```

---

# Scala

```scala
@main
def main() =
  println("hello world")
```
